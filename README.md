The Bounded Context Assessment is a toolkit for assessing the design quality of an individual and an entire domain portfolio of bounded contexts. The purpose of this toolkit is to:

- Compare multiple design alternatives and choose the best
- Identify how the design quality of a single bounded context affects the wider architecture

Currently, the Bounded Context Assessment contains 2 tools:

- Bounded Context Design Assessment (for assessing a single context)

- Bounded Context Portfolio Assessment (for visualizing the design of an entire portfolio and their relations.)
